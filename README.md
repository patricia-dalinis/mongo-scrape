# Mongo Article Scrape

## Bootcamp Homework for Unit 18

### Application Overview

Whenever a user visits the site, the app will scrape stories from an undisclosed news outlet and display them. Each scraped article is saved to the application database. At a minimum, the app will scrape and display the following information for each article:

* Headline - the title of the article

* Summary - a short summary of the article

* URL - the url to the original article

Users will also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
